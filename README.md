* the following program finds the SHORTEST path, and prints the path and length.
* path and lenght printed ONLY WHEN A PATH EXISTS 
* preference order followed : right > down > left > up 
* algorithm used : lee algorithm
* data structures implemented : circular queue and stack (recursion)
* time complexity : O(n^2)
